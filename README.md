## Overview
This project simplifies getting BlueTopo data in your area of interest.

## Background

[BlueTopo](https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/data/bluetopo.html) is a compilation of the best available public bathymetric data of U.S. waters.

Created by [NOAA Office of Coast Survey's](https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/) National Bathymetric Source project, [BlueTopo data](https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/data/bluetopo_specs.html) intends to provide depth information nationwide with the vertical uncertainty tied to that depth estimate as well as information on the survey source that it originated from. 

This data is presented in a multiband high resolution GeoTIFF with an associated raster attribute table. 

For answers to frequently asked questions, visit the [FAQ](https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/data/bluetopo_faq.html).

## Requirements

This codebase is written for Python 3 and relies on the following python
packages:

-   gdal / ogr
-   numpy
-   boto3

## Installation

Download and install conda (If you have not already): [conda installation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)

Download and install git (If you have not already): [git installation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

In the command line, create an environment with the required packages:

```
conda create -n bluetopo_env -c conda-forge 'gdal>=3.4'
```
```
conda activate bluetopo_env
```
```
pip install git+https://github.com/noaa-ocs-hydrography/BlueTopo
```

## Quickstart

To download the desired files, first create a geometry file (such as a geopackage) with a polygon depicting the area of interest.  Then run the following commands inside of a Python shell:

```python
from nbs.bluetopo import fetch_tiles
```
```python
fetch_tiles.main(r'C:\download_path', 'area_of_interest.gpkg')
```

To build a GDAL VRT of the downloaded tiles:
```python
from nbs.bluetopo import build_vrt
```
```python
build_vrt.main(r'C:\download_path')
```

## CLI

You can also use the command line. Confirm the environment we created during installation is activated.

To fetch the latest BlueTopo data, use `fetch_tiles` passing a directory path and a geometry file path with a polygon depicting your area of interest:
```
fetch_tiles -d [DIRECTORY PATH] -g [GEOMETRY FILE PATH]
```
Pass the same directory path to `build_vrt` to create a VRT from the fetched data:
```
build_vrt -d [DIRECTORY PATH]
```
Use `-h` for help and to see additional arguments.

For most usecases, reusing the commands above to stay up to date in your area of interest is adequate.

## Notes

In addition to BlueTopo, modeling data is available. You may target modeling data using the target argument. The
primary difference between the two is the vertical datum. Modeling data is on a low water datum.
